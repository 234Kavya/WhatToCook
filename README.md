🚀 Overview
WhatToEat helps users answer the most stressful everyday question:
👉 “What should I eat today?”

It does this through three intelligent modes:

1. Pantry Mode — Suggest dishes based on available ingredients 
2. Cook Mode — Suggest recipes based on time, cuisine, course, and mood 
3. Order Mode — Suggest delivery options based on cuisine, budget, and delivery time
